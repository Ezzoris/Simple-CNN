# Simple CNN algorithm for beginers

Convolutional neural networks are a subbranch of deep learning and are often used to analyze visual information. Common areas of use can be listed as image and video recognition, recommender systems image classification, medical image analysis and natural language processing.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required libaries.

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Explanation

I used mnist dataset in this algorithm. I defined the necessary classes, determined the model, applied the basic training stages and ensured that the results were output.

I also used different activation functions in 2 separate files, one being ReLU and the other Sigmoid. The difference between Sigmoid and ReLU is that Relu is flat while sigmoid processes intermediate values. Sigmoid's processing of intermediate values ​​may cause errors and may cause problems such as raw input and training output not being accurate.
